# Text Fields

Hi all! In this walkthrough Iâ€™ll be showcasing some simple text fields and how to use them! For this example, I will be creating a simple login page.

## Setup

If you know how I like to set up my projects then you'll be familiar with these file names. If not, maybe check [this](https://github.com/edbarnes01/SwiftUI/tree/main/BeforeYouRead#file-structure) out.

These are the files you're going to need and which option you should choose for each:

- Container (SwiftUI)
- Login     (SwiftUI)
- Main      (SwiftUI)
- Service   (Swift)
- Themes    (Swift)

### Service

Let's set up our service. We'll create 3 variables:
``` swift 
class Service: ObservableObject {
    @Published private(set) var loggedIn = false
    var testEmail = "ed@test.com"
    var testPassword = "password"
}
```
We have our ```loggedIn``` variable which we will change when there is a successful login. Note - I would typically put this inside a ```User()``` object but to simplify, I'm uing a standalone variable and wrapping it in ```private(set)``` so it can only be modified from within the service. Also I've created some credentials for testing.

Before we add some functions, in the same file, just above our ```Service``` class, let's create a new enum:

``` swift 
enum LoginError: String {
    case wrongFields = "One or more fields was incorrect. Please try again."
}
```

This is a simple enum in which the cases have a raw value, which will be a description of a particular login error.

So we also need two functions for our basic functionality within the service - login and logout! Here they are:

``` swift
class Service: ObservableObject {
    @Published private(set) var loggedIn = false
    var testEmail = "ed@test.com"
    var testPassword = "password"
    
    func login(email: String, password: String, failure: @escaping (LoginError?) -> Void) {
        // You would send a request to your backend here
        // but in the meantime:
        if email == testEmail && password == testPassword {
            self.loggedIn = true
        } else {
            failure(.wrongFields)
        }
    }
    
    func logOut() {
        self.loggedIn = false
    }
}
```

The ```logOut()``` function is fairly self explanatory! The ```login```, slightly more advanced. It takes 3 arguments, an email, a password and then an escaping closure. This is a function that will be passed to the function and will be called when we write ```failure()```. This is useful in our sitaution because we want an alert to appear when the user gets their credentials wrong. The service won't have a reference of our alert, so we can send the alert trigger to our login function so it can be called and thus shown whenever the credentials are wrong. I hope this makes sense! In our case, we (might - hence the optional -> "?") pass the closure a ```LoginError``` of which we've only got ```wrongFields``` at the moment. 

And so, within this function, we check that the credentials they have entered are equal to our test ones, and if not, we call our escaping function and run whatever code has been passed.

Glad that's done! Let's move on.

### Page Logic
Our page logic will be dependant on our ```loggedIn``` value within our service. Let's open up ```Container.swift```. Make sure you define the service and then we'll create a switch statement to show the correct page:

``` swift
struct Container: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var service: Service
    
    var body: some View {
        switch self.service.loggedIn {
        case true:
            Main().environmentObject(service)
        case false:
            Login().environmentObject(service)
        }
        
    }
}
```
Awesome!

### Modifiers

Next we're gonna make some ```ViewModifiers``` which are some clever pieces of code we can run views through and apply affects to them. These are extremely useful for creating themes and using them throughout your app. Make sure to import SwiftUI and then let's make 3 modifiers:

``` swift 
import SwiftUI

struct CustomTextField: ViewModifier {
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .autocapitalization(.none)
            .foregroundColor(.black)
            .padding(10)
            .frame(width: UIScreen.main.bounds.width / 5 * 3)
            .background(Color.white)
            .clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 6))
            .clipped()
            .shadow(color: .white, radius: 2)
    }
}

struct CustomButton: ViewModifier {
    var color: Color
    
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .foregroundColor(color == .white ? Color.black : .white )
            .padding(10)
            .background(color)
            .clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 6))
            .clipped()
    }
}

struct BackgroundGradient: ViewModifier {
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
        .background(
            LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [.yellow, .purple, .yellow, .purple]), startPoint: .topLeading, endPoint: .bottomTrailing)
            )
    }
}

```

Now, these modifiers' styles are just what I thought looked okay. Please feel free to mess around and create your own! In general, moifiers are passed some content (a ```View``` for a ```ViewModifier```) into a body function which returns the altered View (the ```return``` keyword is assumed, and therefore not needed in this function). As you can see in the ```CustomButton``` modifier, variables (```color``` in this case) can also be passed in order to add some properties that can be controlled wherever the modifier is applied. 

Another thing I'd like to point out is the use of ```.autocapitalization(.none)``` which for me, is so helpful. ***IT REALLY FRUSTRATES ME WHEN APPS DON'T HAVE AUTOCAPITALIZATION SET TO NONE BECAUSE A LOT OF EMAILS START WITH A LOWERCASE LETTER.***

Rant over! I digress and we move on...

## TextField Bindings

Open up ```Login.swift``` and let's create our login page. We'll need some variables:

``` swift 
struct Login: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var service: Service
    @State var email = ""
    @State var password = ""
    @State var showAlert = false
    @State var alertText = ""

    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello World!")
    }
}
```

Our ```showAlert``` will control wether our alert is shown and the ```alertText``` will be the error message for the user. 
We're going to create our TextFields now but we need some bindings for the text. Inside ```body```, create the following:

``` swift 
struct Login: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var service: Service
    @State var email = ""
    @State var password = ""
    @State var showAlert = false
    @State var alertText = ""

    var body: some View {
        let emailBind = Binding(
            get: {self.email},
            set: {self.email = $0}
        )
        let passwordBind = Binding(
            get: {self.password},
            set: {self.password = $0}
        )
    ...
```
Our custom bindings have two functions, a ```get``` and a ```set```, which define how our text value is grabbed and set. Wtithin these functions, you could add things to process the new value, for example - adding ```.prefix(8)``` to the set would limit the characters of the new value to the first 8. 

Now let's mkae our login UI:

``` swift
VStack(spacing: 20) {
    Spacer()

    Text("BEST APP")
        .font(.system(size: 40))
        .fontWeight(.heavy)
        .foregroundColor(.white)
        .padding()
        .clipped()

    TextField("Email", text: emailBind)
        .modifier(CustomTextField())

    SecureField("Password", text: passwordBind)
        .modifier(CustomTextField())

    Text("Login")
        .fontWeight(.bold)
        .modifier(CustomButton(color: fieldsValid() ? .blue : .gray))
        .shadow(color: .white, radius: 2)
        .padding(.top, 20)
        .disabled(!fieldsValid())

    Spacer()
}
```

So as you can see, there
